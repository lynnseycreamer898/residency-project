###<a id="inclusion"></a> Inclusion & Benefits

---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: 
The learner will demonstrate knowledge of inclusion by expressing the difference between inclusive settings versus non-inclusive settings. 
The learner will demonstrate increased knowledge of inclusion by describing benefits of inclusion.
---------------------------------------------------------
Inclusion:
Inclusion is when people and a group accept all people to join them.  All children should have the same choices, opportunities, acceptance, and welcome.  Social inclusion lets children feel like they belong and have value.  
People sometimes have negative attitudes about children with disabilities.  This can be helped if you focus on similar interest and strengths of all children.  
Appropriate Language:
	Person First Language
You should use "person first" language when talking about a child with a disability. All children with special needs are unique.  They are not defined by their specific diagnosis.  Refer to the child first by using their name and then the diagnosis (if needed).  It is also important to not label a child.  
	Examples:
		Do: 
*	John is a boy with autism.  
*	Sara is a girl with Down syndrome. 
*	Don played the Wii today.
		Do not:  
*	Autistic boy
*	That Down syndrome girl, Sara.
*	Don, the blind boy, played the Wii today.  

Benefits for Children with Special Needs:  
*	Improves self esteem
*	Provides peer role models
*	Provides a sense of belonging
*	Helps develop social skills
*	Improves development
*	Provides identity as a community member
Benefits for Others in the Community:
*	Provides chance to learn to interact with different people
*	Helps develop skills to help others
*	Helps people notice different strengths and unique abilities
*	Improves acceptance of others 
*	Lowers negative attitudes

The learner will describe basic information on the development of play from 6 to 12 years of age. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Play:
Play and peer interaction is important for all children.  It helps them learn and build self-esteem.  All children with disabilities have problems learning and playing in different places.   
A child must feel safe and secure before he or she will play.

Development
Middle Childhood (Ages 6-10)
Children who are ages 6 to 10 years old are in middle childhood.  They begin to structure and organize play.  Games with rules become the main type of physical and social play.  Children may have problems following the rules until 9 to 10 years old. By 8 and 9 years old, children become more interested in sports activities. Children in middle childhood enjoy creating art projects.  They may need adult support for organizing materials and following steps.  Children value playing with peers during middle childhood.  They learn in peer groups to be cooperative and compete.    
Early Adolescence (Ages 10-13)
Early adolescence includes children 10 to 13 years old.  Their thoughts and attitudes are now influenced by their self-esteem, self-worth, and their peers.  They start to focus more on their body image and how others view them.  They like passive activities like video games and TV.  Video games help children be competitive even if they are not good at sports. They also like group sports and board/card games.  Peer interaction is very important during this age.  They mostly make friends with the same gender.  At this age, they can begin to challenge people in authority.  



 
Play Environment
---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: 
The learner will demonstrate understanding of environmental factors that affect behavior. 
The learner will express ways to change the environment in order to promote positive experiences and behaviors. 
---------------------------------------------------------

It is important to look at the environment in which play will occur and the objects within the environment.  The space should offer experiences with creativity, pretend play, change, and chance.  
Reasons for Possible Negative Behaviors:
*	Child is not able to control his or her thoughts, feelings, & actions
*	Child is not overwhelmed (environment is too loud or crowded)
*	Child is bored
Sensory Problems
The way the brain processes sensory information (sight, touch, sound, etc.) can affect how a child acts in a setting.  A child can under stimulated and seek more sensory input.  A child could also be over stimulated and seek less sensory input.  This can cause the child to have problems controlling his or her thoughts, feelings, and action.  
	Sensory Avoiders:
The body avoids sensory stimuli if it takes in too much information.  A child may act upset or threatened if overwhelmed by sensory information.  This child may be upset by changes in routine, loud noises, and crowded settings.  

	Sensory Seekers:

A sensory seeker is a person who 
A child who does not receive enough sensory stimulation seeks extra stimulation.  Behaviors seen in children who do not register enough sensory information are often not organized, difficulty to engage, bump into items, touch, or chew non-edible items.  This child may hurt him or herself because they do not tell the difference between hot or sharp items. 
Environment Changes to Prevent Behaviors:

*	Keep the room arranged as predictable as possible
*	Decrease additional noise
*	Define clear rules & post them within the room
*	Decide on consequences of broken rules
*	Define areas and add Pictures
	*	Ex. "Art Table"

 
Behaviors & Accommodations
---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: 
The learner will gain better understanding of common disabilities in order to better modify the environment to support all children. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Behavior is affected by the environment, another person, and the child. The way others respond to a child’s action can cause the child to stop or repeat the action. 
Behavior is often the way a child is trying to communicate.  
Behavior Techniques:

*	Positive Reinforcers

Giving Directions:

*	Make eye contact
*	Keep voice low
*	Give only 1 to 2 directions at a time
*	Be specific
*	Put directions into simple terms
*	Give time to respond
*	Repeat if needed

Strategies to Prevent/Stop Behaviors:

*	Expect appropriate behavior 
*	Support and Model the behaviors you would like kids to show 
	*	"Jason I bet Alex would like to play"
*	Model communication skills 
*	Teach children how to deal with conflict
	*	Help him or her talk about feelings instead of acting on them
*	Prepare children for changes
	*	Sharing the Wii
	*	Coming in from outside

	*	If a child is upset, encourage the child to tell the other child what is upsetting him or her
	*	Help the child find words to describe the emotion 
*	Teach Social Skills
	*	Teach children how to take turns
	*	Teach children how to ask a child to play
	*	Teach children how to introduce him or herself
*	Praise positive behaviors
*	Help the child find a quiet play to calm down
*	This is to regain self-control, not for punishment 



Behaviors
Tantrum
*	Prevent the problem 
*	Stay calm
*	Determine the reason behind the behavior if possible
*	Stay close enough to prevent the child from harming himself or others 
*	Use simple language to help a child regain control during a tantrum
*	Help the child communicate "Use your words"
Aggression

Inappropriate language
Chewing on Items
*	Sometimes children chew items that should not be chewed on.  
*	Staff could encourage parents to pack chewy, crunchy, or sour items that are appropriate items to chew on like:
	*	Gum
	*	Chewy granola bars
	*	Fruit Bars
	*	Bagels
	*	Pretzels
	*	Sour Candy
	*	Gummy Worms
	*	Suckers

Bullying
---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: 
The learner will demonstrate knowledge of different types of bullying.
The learner will demonstrate knowledge of who is at risk for bullying in order to prevent bullying from occurring. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Bullying:
Bullying can be defined as 
*	A difference in physical, social, or emotional power between the victim and bully
*	Purpose is to cause emotional or physical harm to the victim
*	Act is typically repeated over a time period
Types of Bullying:
*	Physical 
*	Verbal
*	Indirect (emotional or social)
*	Sexual

Children with a disability are at a higher risk for being the victim of a bully. This is because they sometimes are passive, have less close friendships, poor social skills, and have problem behaviors.  
Being bullied can lead to fear, depression, poor self-esteem, lack of confidence, and less social participation.  
Children who are bullied can have feelings of fear, depression, low self-esteem, less confidence, and loneliness.  
Bullying is typically decreased in supported inclusive settings.  If students with disabilities are not fully combined with their peers, inclusive settings could increase bullying.  It is essential for adults to be aware of bullying and to realize the importance of supporting all students within their peer groups.  
Protection against bullying:
*	Positive self-concept
*	Social skills
*	Independence 
*	Social confidence
*	Quality friend group
Prevent bullying:
*	Teach social skills
*	Teach social awareness
*	Encourage positive social interactions
*	Provide a social structure that is equal

 
Activities & Suggestions
---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: 
The learner will understand the importance of changing the activity to fit different children’s strengths.
The learner will identify ways to change activities to help all children be successful.  
---------------------------------------------------------
Activities need to  be changed to make sure a child is successful.  A hard activity can cause a child to quit or become upset.  Activities that are too easy also lead to a child not finishing.  You should determine why the child is not successful and make changes.  It may be the environment, tools, rules, instructions, or physical requirement. 
It is important to create a safe and inviting environment for play.  Keep the environment clean, organized, and remove all hazards. 
It is best to make activities cooperative instead of competitive.  Cooperative play is working together as a team.  Competitive play can cause anxiety and aggression.  It is helpful to change the focus of games to reach a common goal when possible.  Staff can help support cooperative play by placing children into groups and making cooperative rules.  They should model positive behavior and praise children when they work together.
